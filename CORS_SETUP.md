# Firebase Storage CORS Configuration

## Issue
The TensorFlow.js image processing is failing due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions when loading images from Firebase Storage.

## Error Messages
- `Access to image at 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...' has been blocked by CORS policy`
- `Failed to execute 'texSubImage2D' on 'WebGL2RenderingContext': Tainted canvases may not be loaded`

## Solution

### Option 1: Configure Firebase Storage CORS (Recommended)

1. Install Google Cloud SDK if not already installed
2. Create a `cors.json` file in your project root:

```json
[
  {
    "origin": ["http://localhost:5173", "http://localhost:3000", "https://yourdomain.com"],
    "method": ["GET"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

3. Run the following command to apply CORS configuration:
```bash
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://ki-82889.appspot.com
```

### Option 2: Use Firebase Storage Download URLs with CORS Headers

Update your Firebase Storage rules to allow CORS:

```javascript
// In Firebase Console > Storage > Rules
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      // Add CORS headers
      allow read: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Current Fallback Implementation

The current code already implements fallback strategies:

1. **Fetch API with Blob**: Tries to fetch the image as a blob and create an object URL
2. **Direct Image Loading**: Falls back to direct image element loading
3. **Manual Review**: When automatic processing fails, marks for manual review

## Current Status

The application now handles CORS issues gracefully by:
- ✅ Attempting multiple loading strategies
- ✅ Providing meaningful error messages
- ✅ Falling back to manual review when automatic processing fails
- ✅ Still allowing image viewing and manual verification

## Testing

To test if CORS is properly configured:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try to verify a registration
4. Check if image requests show CORS errors

## Notes

- The application will still function even with CORS issues
- Manual review will be required when automatic processing fails
- Images are still viewable in the interface
- All functionality remains available, just with manual verification instead of automatic
